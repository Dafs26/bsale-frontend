This page is made to be a frontend app for an ecommerce
It works using fetch function of javascript to search the information from the API that provides all the products.
The search bar works by directly making a request to the API looking for the coincidences with the text provided by the user.
This page is also deployed in Heroku
-https://bsaletest-frontend.herokuapp.com/ (Heroku deletes the image files after a while the image display is not broken).
